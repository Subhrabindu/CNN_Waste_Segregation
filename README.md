**Project Overview:**

This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for classifying waste images into seven distinct material types. By automating the waste sorting process, we aim to enhance recycling efficiency and contribute to environmental sustainability.

**Business Objective:**

Develop a deep learning-based waste classification system using a CNN that can accurately classify at least waste images across 7 material categories
- Automate waste sorting to reduce time and labor.
- Enhance recycling rates through precise classification.
- Promote sustainable environmental practices.

**1) Dataset and Waste Categories:**

 The dataset consists of approximately **7,000 raw images** distributed into **seven categories**:

- Cardboard  
- Food Waste  
- Glass  
- Metal  
- Other  
- Paper  
- Plastic  

Each category is stored in its respective folder containing images of items that fall under that class. For example, the `Food_Waste` folder may contain coffee grounds, tea bags, and fruit peels — without being further subcategorized.

**2) Features:**

* Data Preparation: Load & Preprocess Images.
* Data Visualization: Created Bar plot of class distribution, Sample image visualization and Resized images based on min/max dimensions
* Class Encoding: Encoded class labels for model input.
* Train-Test Split: Divided data into training and validation sets.
* Model Architecture & Training: Built, compiled, and trained a CNN model
* Testing & Evaluation: Evaluated performance using metrics
        - Accuracy  
        - Loss 
* Data Augmentation(Optional): Used image transformations to boost generalization (rotation, flipping, brightness adjustments)
  
**3) Technologies Used:**

 *   Python
 *   TensorFlow
 *   Matplotlib
 *   NumPy
 *   Pandas
 *   Seaborn
    
**4) Model Performance:**

 *   Validation Loss: 3.5291    
 *   Validation Accuracy: 0.4845

 **5) Future Improvements:**

 From this project, you can continuously working to enhance the waste classification system. Future improvements include:

* **Smart Waste Bins:** Integrate the CNN model into automated bins that classify waste as soon as it's dropped in. Reduces human error in segregation and increases recycling efficiency.   
* **Real-time Sorting in Waste Plants:** The model can identify and separate recyclable materials on the fly.    
* **Educational Tools:** Use the model in schools and campaigns to teach proper waste segregation.    
* **Detecting Contaminated or Improper Waste:** Train the model to detect if waste is improperly prepared (e.g., food inside plastic containers). Could alert users or workers to clean/sort before processing.    
* **Assistive Tech for Low-Income or Informal Workers:** Deploy AI cameras on sorting stations used by informal workers in developing regions. Helps improve safety, efficiency, and income by identifying valuable materials quickly

**6) Environmental Impact:** 

* **Increased Recycling Efficiency:** Precise waste classification ensures that recyclables are correctly sorted, avoiding contamination (e.g., food waste mixed with paper). Leads to more materials being reused rather than dumped in landfills.    
* **Protection of Water Bodies:** Prevents improper disposal of harmful materials like e-waste or plastic, which can leak chemicals into rivers and oceans.     
* **Promotes Circular Economy:** Cleanly sorted recyclables can be reintroduced into the production cycle. Reduces the need for raw material extraction (mining, deforestation, etc.), preserving natural ecosystems.     
* **Cleaner Urban Environments:** Smarter waste classification helps cities manage their trash more efficiently. Leads to cleaner streets, less overflow, and better public health outcomes.

**8) Conclusion:**

The CNN model demonstrated strong performance for well-represented classes like Plastic and Food Waste, but struggled significantly with underrepresented or visually similar categories such as Glass, Metal, and Other. 
A major issue identified was the model's bias toward predicting "Plastic", likely due to class imbalance and overlapping visual features among waste types. 
The confusion matrix revealed substantial misclassifications, highlighting the need for better data balance, refined class definitions, and enhanced model strategies such as class weighting or attention mechanisms. 
Addressing these issues could lead to more accurate and reliable waste classification, especially for challenging categories.
